# OOMAssignment

An indivudal third year assignment for Object Oriented Methods in Computing that provides a generic implementation of a Map class in C++.

Includes standard STL features and a custom iterator class. 
It should be noted that the allocator and deallocator functions are currently incorrectly implemented and do not provide the same functionality that the STL allocator does.
